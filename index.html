      <p>Hi, my name is Yaw Owusu Afriyie Boateng.<br>
      I am a medical doctor at Korle-Bu Teaching Hospital and I am learning HTML.<br>
      This is the first webpage I am creating in my github repository.
      </p>
    <h2 align="center">My Motivation</h2>
      <p>I have always found it fascinating how programming or coding is used to create tailored<br>
      solutions to a need. Just having the opportunity to write some code brings me satisfaction.<br>
      Furthermore, I think it would be a good idea to make more money while doing what I love to <br>
      do, seeing as tech jobs are increasingly in demand and tend to pay well.
